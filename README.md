# Face_Recognition_NCNN_CPP

üìå **Realtime Face Recognition using NCNN and C++ on Linux**

This project implements a real-time face recognition system using [Tencent's NCNN framework](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) with pre-trained models like RetinaFace and ArcFace. The system detects faces from webcam, aligns them, extracts embeddings, and compares them to determine identity in real-time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components & Features

### 1. **Face Detection (RetinaFace)**
- Detects faces in image or webcam using `mnet.25-opt` model.
- Uses NCNN for fast inference.
- Applies Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) with IoU threshold `0.4`.
- Extracts 5-point facial landmarks for alignment.

### 2. **Face Alignment**
- Aligns detected faces to `112x112` size using affine transformation from landmarks.

### 3. **Embedding Extraction (ArcFace)**
- Uses ArcFace model to extract a 512-dimensional vector per face.
- Embedding vectors are saved as `.txt`.

### 4. **Face Recognition**
- Cosine similarity is used to compare two embeddings.
- If similarity ‚â• `0.5`, same person.
- Real-time recognition from camera stream with label overlay.

## üß± Build Instructions

### üîß Requirements
- Linux system
- CMake
- OpenCV (>= 3.4)
- NCNN (already cloned in `ncnn/`)

### üì• Build steps

```bash
# Clone your own repository (after uploading to GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Face_Recognition_NCNN_CPP.git
cd Face_Recognition_NCNN_CPP

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Build using CMake
cmake ..
make
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### 1. **Detect & Align Faces**
```bash
./main ../input/face1.jpg
```

### 2. **Extract Embedding**
```bash
./embedding ../output/face1.jpg ../output/embedding/face1_embedding.txt
```

### 3. **Compare Two Embeddings**
```bash
./compare_embedding ../output/embedding/face1_embedding.txt ../output/embedding/face2_embedding.txt
```

### 4. **Real-Time Face Recognition**
```bash
./recognition ../output/embedding/face1_embedding.txt 0
```
- Replace `0` with the appropriate webcam index if needed.
